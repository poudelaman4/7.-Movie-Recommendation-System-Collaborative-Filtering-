### Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬

This project implements a movie recommender system using item-based collaborative filtering on the MovieLens 100K dataset. It recommends movies by finding others with similar user rating patterns.

---

### Process

* **Data Preparation:** User ratings and movie data are merged into a single DataFrame.
* **User-Item Matrix:** The data is transformed into a sparse matrix where users are rows and movies are columns.
* **Similarity Calculation:** **Cosine Similarity** is used to find how similarly two movies were rated by users.
* **Recommendation:** Recommendations are generated by identifying the movies most similar to a user's highly-rated movies.

### Evaluation

To assess the model's performance, two key metrics were used:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** This metric measures the average difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings.
    * **Score:** 1.01
    * (A score of ~1.01 is **good for a simple model**, as it indicates that on a 1-5 star scale, the average prediction is off by about one star.)
* **Precision@10:** This metric measures the percentage of the top 10 recommendations that are relevant to the user's interests.
    * **Score:** 0.0803
    * (This score is **typical for a simple model**, indicating that roughly 8% of the top 10 recommendations were relevant to the user.)
